## About Me

Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with 6+ years building production ML systems end-to-end, from problem framing and experimentation to deployment, monitoring, and iteration. I specialize in NLP, computer vision, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.

Currently, I serve as **Lead Data Scientist at Training Arc**, where I build player-facing analytics using telemetry data and video-based computer vision pipelines. I also hold an appointment as **Adjunct Professor, Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia (UBC)**, teaching production ML workflows, validation strategies, and data analytics.

I received my MSc in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba, where my thesis focused on disentangled variational autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection. My research interests include anomaly detection, representation learning, and probabilistic modeling.

## Selected Project Experience

**Real-Time Video Analytics Pipeline**  
Built an end-to-end computer vision pipeline for frame extraction, object detection using YOLO-based models, temporal event tracking, and metric computation. Implemented timestamp alignment, config-driven execution, and structured output formats for downstream analytics.

**Ranking and Personalization System**  
Designed a ranking service using gradient-boosted models and embedding features, served through a low-latency API with caching and feature hydration. Built offline evaluation framework (NDCG, precision@k) with drift monitoring and regression detection.

**Customer Lifecycle Prediction**  
Developed predictive models for user behavior using engagement and transaction signals. Implemented feature pipelines with backtesting support, SHAP-based explainability for stakeholder reporting, and automated recalibration workflows.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assistant**  
Built a retrieval-based Q&A system using embedding pipelines and vector search with citation-style outputs. Developed rubric-driven evaluation harness with test suites, edge-case probes, and quality guardrails for production deployment.

**Generative Models for Anomaly Detection**  
Implemented disentangled variational autoencoders (DCVAE) combining conditional structure with total-correlation regularization for unsupervised anomaly detection. Published benchmarking results across multiple datasets with reproducible training pipelines.

**KPI Layer and Experimentation Platform**  
Built standardized metric definitions and A/B analysis workflows backed by warehouse-first architecture. Delivered executive dashboards with automated refresh, data quality gates, and anomaly alerting.
